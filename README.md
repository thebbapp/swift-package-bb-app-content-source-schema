# ``BbAppContentSourceSchema``

Protocol definitions and data structures for content sources.

## Overview

The BbAppContentSourceSchema library defines the protocols and data structures that all content source implementations must conform to. It includes the ``BbAppContentSourceProtocol`` that defines the contract for content source providers, along with data structures for identity, authentication results, and content source configuration. This schema enables a modular architecture where different content backends can be seamlessly integrated into the application.
